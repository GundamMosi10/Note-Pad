# Note-Pad
 

  ## Description: 
  This is a note-pad/note-taker application that is deployed from Heroku. This app has two pages that emcompass everything that it has; one being a landing page where once you click the central button it takes you to the note taking page. On this page you can write a title and body of the note and it will be saved to the data-base on the left side of the page. You can also click on notes that are in the list on the left and bring them up on the right-side of the page in full view. You can also refresh the page and notes will still be there, other functionality includes when you write a note there is a save button that appears in the upper right of the page to save as well a plus sign to write a new note. You can also go back to the landing page by clicking on the text: 'Note Taker' in the upper left of the page.

  ## Installation:
  First by downloading the corresponding code repository to your computer, next you want to check and see if express and uuid are installed in the package.json file. If not then you can use the command line with the integrated terminal in VS code to install them; code: npm install express and npm install uuid respectively. Now that these are both installed we can run the application from the command line: type in npm start, this shoud start the server for this app. The output will say something along the lines of listening at: http://localhost:3001, you can now follow that link or copy and paste it to a browser and you should be able to see the same web app as the link above with the 'demo'.
