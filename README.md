# Note-Pad
 

  ## Description: 
  This is a note-pad/note-taker application that is deployed from Heroku. This app has two pages that emcompass everything that it has; one being a landing page where once you click the central button it takes you to the note taking page. On this page you can write a title and body of the note and it will be saved to the data-base on the left side of the page. You can also delete notes with the red delete icon button next to the note on the left side of the page. You are also able to refresh your page and the note(s) will still be there unless your delete them.
